### Create the inference engine for the yolo-nas model. -> Done

### Try and see if cropping the person and training a weapon detection only(exclude the person class) will improve the model quality. If its the case, then we can use a yolox-tiny for person detection and yolo-nas or yolox for weapon detection on the cropped person.


### Create a fine-tuning script for supported models.
